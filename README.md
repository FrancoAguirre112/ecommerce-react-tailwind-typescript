The Commerce Website is a web application built using React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. It empowers users to explore a diverse range of products, access detailed information about them, and seamlessly add them to their cart. The application includes various functionalities, between them: contextual cart management, product searches through the Fake Store API, retrieval of comprehensive product details from the API, and secure routing using React Router DOM.

## Features

**Cart functionality using Contexts:** Through the implementation of React contexts, users can dynamically add and remove products from their carts, ensuring a fluid and responsive shopping experience.

**Product search using the Fake Store API:** The application seamlessly integrates with the Fake Store API, enabling users to search for products based on names or categories. Whether entering a specific product name or selecting a category, the app efficiently retrieves relevant product results from the API.

**Retrieve product details from API:** Upon selecting a product from the search results, the app fetches additional intricate details about the chosen product directly from the Fake Store API.

**Safe Routing with React Router DOM:** The app utilizes React Router DOM for safe and seamless navigation between different pages and components. It ensures that users can access specific routes and components based on their authentication status.

**Pixel perfect translation of a figma design to a live app:** The website design is **heavily** inspired by [Jhanvi Shah's Euphoria - Ecommerce figma design.](https://ecommerce-react-tailwind-typescript.vercel.app/)
